# MBTI-PREDICTION

:date: Creation date: October 2020 

## :dart: Objective

Predict the user's MBTI profile from a few sentences defining it.

The **Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)** is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test attempts to assign four categories:
- introversion (I) or extraversion (E),
- sensing (S) or intuition (N), 
- thinking (T) or feeling (F), 
- judging (J) or perceiving (P).

One letter from each category is taken to produce a four-letter test result, like "INFJ" or "ENFP".
